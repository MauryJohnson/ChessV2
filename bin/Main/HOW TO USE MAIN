Game is where Game starts
ChessXX is NOTHING
Board Depends on Game
Player Depends on Board

Player Set Up
Every Piece k must have created piece k-1,...1 in order to set up each piece position and type correctly.
This only has to be worried about initializing board. Adding new players to linked list should not effect
this.

GamePlay
Each movement is done in game.
########################### MAKE SURE TO USE SwapPlayer(); EACH TIME YOU PERFORM A MOVE!! STARTING AT P1!! OR ELSE 
WON't WORK!!
If invalid move, ReturnStatusMove will return -1
If valid move to free or attacked space, ReturnStatusMove return 0
If valid move to free or attacked space and put opponent in check, return 1


Always swap player each move, also every two moves, call FinishMoveTwice() 
to check if opponent pawns moved twice set their MovedTwice Flag to false then

KillPiece and MoveStillCheck should be modified for enpassant/Castling movements...
Castling is easier, just add if case

Practice both of these special moves in KillPiece first


*********File AllOut is the output file, output too large to get all output on console

Look for flags for check:

CTRL+F - Find these key words to verify movements

KillPiece1,KillPiece2,.. - To see the backend for every movement in the game
KillPiece1 - To look at each movement
KillPiece2,..,KillPiece7 - look at the backend details like board generation to check for a bad move

MeInCheck1,MeInCheck2,... - To see the process to check how you're in check
MeInCheck - Look at all details about checking if player in check

OpponentInCheck1,OpponentInCheck2,... - To see the process to check how opponent in check
OpponentInCheck - same as MeInCheck, function actually swaps player ID and calls MeInCheck

MoveStillCheck1,MoveStillCheck2,... - To see if opponent is in check and still in check given their options
MoveStillCheck - Look at all details about checking if a generated environment given a unique 
move can get king out of check.

--These are to look for outputs where it cals MeInCheck for castling move on king temporary positions.

########################   In debugging If you ever see something like w# KK or b# RR, that means that w# or b# is
a temporary position placed for that piece, until it's permanently placed at w# or b#, this is typical
for castling function

*************__PRINT BOARD__ - To see every time board is printed for any of these steps
