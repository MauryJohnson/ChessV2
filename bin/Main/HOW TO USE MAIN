Game is where Game starts
ChessXX is NOTHING
Board Depends on Game
Player Depends on Board

Player Set Up
Every Piece k must have created piece k-1,...1 in order to set up each piece position and type correctly.
This only has to be worried about initializing board. Adding new players to linked list should not effect
this.

GamePlay
Each movement is done in game.
########################### MAKE SURE TO USE SwapPlayer(); EACH TIME YOU PERFORM A MOVE!! STARTING AT P1!! OR ELSE 
WON't WORK!!
If invalid move, ReturnStatusMove will return -1
If valid move to free or attacked space, ReturnStatusMove return 0
If valid move to free or attacked space and put opponent in check, return 1


Always swap player each move, also every two moves, call FinishMoveTwice() 
to check if opponent pawns moved twice set their MovedTwice Flag to false then
