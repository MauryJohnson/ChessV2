How to use apply!

In Game class, create players 1,2
Then select a piece to Try a move


[1,....,8] are in the coordinates corresponding to the clockwise positions of the piece.
[9,....,16] determine if that piece is enemy in the one to one correspondence with the FIRST SET 
in terms of position
[>=17] - piece is an ally
[<=0] - ERROR cases... -1 if out of bounds...

apply one of these ints corresponding to the transition from pos1[] to pos2[]. 

Of course, each piece will have to interpolate if this is valid for their moveset.

************Pieces that do more than one move need to be given a for 
loop. If case fails while still iterating, stop there and return the fail case
OTHERWISE, Return the position it made it to WITHIN THE BOARD

for each try move, the input is an integer. If integer ==0, 
this is the movement of 1 unit in the given function direction.

[0,...,7] corresponds to can move 1,...,8 units in the function direction.

If pawn, can only use integer one once, on first turn


IterateThrough(FP,Case,i)
i is how far to iterate
FP is First Point, 
Case = 0 -> Down
Case = 1 -> Up
Case = 2 -> Left 
Case = 3 -> Right 
Case = 4 -> UpLeft
Case = 5 -> UpRight, 
Case = 6 -> DownRight, 
Case = 7 -> DownLeft
